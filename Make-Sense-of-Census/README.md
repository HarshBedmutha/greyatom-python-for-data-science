### Learnings from the project

 After Completing this project gain a better grip of numpy programming skills applied functions like Array Appending, Array Slicing, Array Filtering, Array Aggregation.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The first step was to read the data, and loaded the data to a numpy array and added a new record to it. Second step was to do a simple analysis of the age distribution which required data wrangling skills. In third step identified the minorities using race attribute so to find the minimum minority_race then created new sub-array for senior citizen and looked at the data and checked if that policy of working hours for senior citizen is followed.
